### Functionalities

## Key Features 
1. **Interactive Dental Health Assistance:**

- Users can input their dental health-related questions, and the chatbot will provide accurate and relevant responses to help them understand their symptoms and conditions better.
  
2. **Step-by-Step Interaction:**

- The chatbot engages users with multiple prompts to gather detailed information before offering a conclusion or advice. This ensures a thorough understanding of the user's situation.
  
3. **Maintains Chat History:**

- All interactions are archived within a scrollable container, allowing users to review past conversations easily. This feature helps in maintaining continuity in the discussion.
  
4. **Reset Conversation:**

- Users can reset the conversation at any time to start a new session. This feature clears all previous chat history and allows users to commence a new interaction with the chatbot.
  
5. **Personalized Interaction:**

- The chatbot introduces itself as Gigi, the AI dentist, and provides a welcoming introduction to make the interaction more friendly and engaging.

## How It Works

1. **Launching the Chat:**

- Upon opening the application, users encounter a text input field where they can enter their dental inquiries.

2. **Multiple Prompts for Detailed Information:**

- The chatbot first asks about the user's dental history, followed by specific questions about their current dental issues. This step-by-step approach ensures comprehensive data collection before providing any conclusions.

3. **Accurate Responses Using Generative AI:**

-The chatbot utilizes Gemini, Google's Generative AI model, to generate accurate and helpful responses based on the user's input.

4. **Continuing the Conversation:**

- Users can continue to ask follow-up questions, and the chatbot will respond accordingly, maintaining the flow of the conversation without resetting.

5. **Resetting the Conversation:**

- If users wish to start a new session, they can reset the conversation, which clears the chat history and interaction count, allowing for a fresh start.
