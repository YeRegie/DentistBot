This chatbot is crafted to offer essential health insights and assist you with basic questions regarding symptoms, dental conditions, and wellness tips. Let's get started with these straightforward instructions for engaging with the chatbot:

1. **Launching the Chat**\n
Upon opening the application, you'll encounter a text input field labeled **"Enter your dental inquiry here:"**\n. This is where you'll pose your questions.\n
2. **Submitting Your Inquiry**\n
Enter your question in the text box, ensuring it remains focused on dental symptoms or health conditions. For instance, rather than stating **"I feel unwell,"** you could inquire, **"What are common causes of tooth sensitivity?"** or simply state your symptom, such as **"Toothache."** Optionally, you can include any suspected causes for a more precise response.
Press the "Ask Gigi" button to send your question.\n
3. **Viewing Responses**\n
Once you've submitted your question, Gigi, your AI dental assistant, will process your query and provide a response below the input field.\n
4. **Continuing the Conversation**\n
Should you have additional questions for Gigi, simply type them into the text box and click **"Ask Gigi"** again. Each new and previous conversation will be archived in a scrollable container, facilitating easy review of past interactions.\n

This chatbot is crafted to offer essential health insights and assist you with basic questions regarding symptoms, dental conditions, and wellness tips. Let's get started with these straightforward instructions for engaging with the chatbot:

1. **Launching the Chat**\n
Upon opening the application, you'll encounter a text input field labeled **"Enter your dental inquiry here:"**\n. This is where you'll pose your questions.\n
2. **Submitting Your Inquiry**\n
Enter your question in the text box, ensuring it remains focused on dental symptoms or health conditions. For instance, rather than stating **"I feel unwell,"** you could inquire, **"What are common causes of tooth sensitivity?"** or simply state your symptom, such as **"Toothache."** Optionally, you can include any suspected causes for a more precise response.
Press the "Ask Gigi" button to send your question.\n
3. **Viewing Responses**\n
Once you've submitted your question, Gigi, your AI dental assistant, will process your query and provide a response below the input field.\n
4. **Continuing the Conversation**\n
Should you have additional questions for Gigi, simply type them into the text box and click **"Ask Gigi"** again. Each new and previous conversation will be archived in a scrollable container, facilitating easy review of past interactions.\n
5. **Resetting the Conversation**\n
To initiate a new session and clear all prior conversations, utilize the **"Reset Conversation"** button. This action will erase all chat history, allowing you to commence anew.\n

Explanation of Changes:
Removed Expander for "Gigi's Smile Support: Getting Started": The text is directly shown using st.markdown.
Added Steps for Interaction:
Step 0: The first user input is used to collect dental history.
Step 1: Prompt the user to provide more details about their dental history.
Step 2: Handle the main problem and provide a concluding response.
Managed Steps with st.session_state.step: This state variable tracks which step of the interaction sequence the user is in, ensuring at least two prompts before reaching a conclusion.
By following this approach, you ensure the user goes through multiple prompts before concluding the conversation.

Modify my code, I want you to remove the expander in the Display info about the creator and just show the complete info also I want the it to have a title "Info about the Developer" in BOLD also I want it to have the user to have multiple prompts without resetting the conversation if i have a follow up question.
